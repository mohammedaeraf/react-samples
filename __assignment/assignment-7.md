## **üîπ React Assignment: Toggle Switch Component**  

### **üìå Problem Statement**  
Create a **React component** that displays a toggle switch. The switch should:  
1. **Show an "ON" or "OFF" status** based on its state.  
2. **Display an image** (`on.jpg` when ON, `off.jpg` when OFF).  
3. **Toggle the state when the image is clicked** (switch between ON and OFF).  

---

### **üîπ Requirements**  
- Use the `useState` hook to manage the toggle state (`isOn`).  
- Use the ternary operator (`? :`) to dynamically change the image and text.  
- Import and use images (`on.jpg` and `off.jpg`) from the `assets` folder.  
- When the image is clicked, **toggle the state** to update the UI.

### **üîπ Expected Behavior**  
| **Initial State** | **On Click (Toggle State)** |  
|-------------------|---------------------------|  
| Shows "OFF" with `off.jpg` | Shows "ON" with `on.jpg` |  
| Clicking the image toggles it **ON** | Clicking again toggles it **OFF** |
