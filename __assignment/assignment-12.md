### **📌 Assignment: Filtering Products Using a Search Box**

#### **📝 Problem Statement**

Create a **React component** that fetches product data from `https://dummyjson.com/products` and displays a **list of products**. Implement a **search functionality** that allows users to filter the products dynamically as they type in a search box.

#### **📌 Requirements:**

1️⃣ Fetch product data from **DummyJSON API** (`https://dummyjson.com/products`).  
2️⃣ Display each product’s **title and price** in a list.  
3️⃣ Add a **search input field** that filters products in real-time.  
4️⃣ Ensure **case-insensitive search** so that both "iphone" and "iPhone" return results.  
5️⃣ Display **"No products found"** if no results match the search query.

#### **🔍 Example API Response (Partial)**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "iPhone 9",
  "price": 549
}
```
